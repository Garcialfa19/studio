/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a public read-only model for general users,
 * while allowing any authenticated user to perform write operations.
 * This is suitable for an admin-managed application where all logged-in
 * users are considered administrators.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /routes/{routeId}: Stores route information.
 * - /alerts/{alertId}: Stores alert messages.
 * - /drivers/{driverId}: Stores driver information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted for all collections.
 * - Write operations (create, update, delete) are restricted to authenticated users.
